    "# Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "# An object is an instance of a class. It contains data and methods that operate on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    # Class attributes\n",
    "    wheels = 4\n",

    "# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "# The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "# 1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n",
    "# 2. Abstraction: Hiding the internal implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user.\n",
    "# 3. Inheritance: A mechanism that allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.\n",
    "# 4. Polymorphism: The ability of a function or method to work with different types of data or to override methods in derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "# The __init__() function is a special method in Python classes. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created.\n",
    "# The purpose of __init__() is to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # Constructor to initialize object\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "dog1.speak()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "\n",

    "# Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "# The 'self' keyword is used in Python to represent the instance of the class. It allows access to the attributes and methods of the class.\n",
    "# It is required to reference the instance of the object being created and to differentiate between instance variables and local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # 'self.name' is the instance attribute\n",

    "# Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "# Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a class (child class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).\n",
    "# Types of inheritance:\n",
    "# 1. Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from one superclass.\n",
    "# 2. Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses.\n",
    "# 3. Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from another subclass.\n",
