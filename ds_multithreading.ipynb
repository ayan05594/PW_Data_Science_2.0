    "# Multithreading is a concurrent execution technique where different parts of a program are executed \n",

    "# The 'threading' module in Python is used for creating and managing threads to execute \n",

    "\n",
    "# ActiveCount() - This function returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "# CurrentThread() - This function returns the current Thread object corresponding to the callerâ€™s thread of execution.\n",

    "# Q3. Explain the following functions:\n",

    "# run() - The 'run()' method is used to define the task to be executed in a thread.\n",
    "# It is called when the thread is started.\n",

    "# start() - The 'start()' method is used to begin the thread's activity.\n",
    "# It invokes the run() method of the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "# join() - The 'join()' method blocks the execution of the calling thread until the thread whose join() method was called has finished executing.\n",
