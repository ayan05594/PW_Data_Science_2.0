    "# Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "# Multiprocessing is a technique used in Python to run multiple processes concurrently. \n",
    "# Each process has its own memory space and executes independently. It is useful because \n",
    "# it allows Python to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and use multiple CPU cores,\n",
    "# which is particularly helpful for CPU-bound tasks, providing significant performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Multiprocessing uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space, whereas multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process.\n",
    "# 2. Multiprocessing can be used to perform CPU-bound tasks efficiently, whereas multithreading is better for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "# 3. Multiprocessing bypasses the GIL and can use multiple CPU cores, whereas multithreading is limited by the GIL.\n",
    "# 4. Multiprocessing requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like queues, while multithreading shares the same memory space.\n",
