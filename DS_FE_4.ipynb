        "- **Data encoding** is the process of converting categorical data (such as strings or labels) into numerical formats that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It is essential in data science because most machine learning algorithms require numerical data to perform computations. By encoding categorical features, we enable algorithms to process the data, making it suitable for modeling.\n",

        "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
        "- **Nominal encoding** is a type of encoding used for categorical variables where the categories do not have any specific order or relationship. It is commonly used for nominal (non-ordinal) categorical features. Nominal encoding maps each unique category to a distinct numerical value.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  If we have a feature `Color` with values [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"], nominal encoding would map these values to numbers like:\n",
        "  - Red → 1\n",
        "  - Blue → 2\n",
        "  - Green → 3\n",
        "\n",
        "  In a real-world scenario, such as a marketing analysis, if we are analyzing customer preferences based on color choices (red, blue, green), nominal encoding can be used to transform the categorical feature `Color` into numerical values to apply to machine learning models.\n",

        "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",

        "  Example:\n",
        "  If we have a feature like `Zip Code` with a large number of unique values (e.g., 1000 unique zip codes), using **nominal encoding** would be more efficient than one-hot encoding because one-hot encoding would create 1000 new columns, leading to a sparse matrix and potential computational inefficiency.\n",
