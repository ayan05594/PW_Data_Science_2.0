        "# A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.\n",
        "# SQL databases are relational and use structured query language to define and manipulate data. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.\n",
        "# NoSQL databases are non-relational and store unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra.\n",

        "# DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to define and modify database structures.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# CREATE TABLE students (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));\n",
