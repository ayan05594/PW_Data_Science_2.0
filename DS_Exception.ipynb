    "# Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, it disrupts the normal flow of the program, and the program may terminate unless the exception is handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Differences between Exceptions and Syntax errors:\n",
    "# - **Exceptions** occur during program execution. They are typically caught and handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "# - **Syntax errors** occur when there is an issue with the syntax of the code (e.g., missing parentheses or indentation problems). They are detected during the compilation of the code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of an exception:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero raises an exception\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",

    "# Uncomment to test:\n",
