        "'''\n",
        "The **Decision Tree Classifier** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on feature values to make predictions. The tree structure consists of nodes where:\n",
        "1. **Root Node**: Represents the entire dataset.\n",
        "2. **Internal Nodes**: Each node represents a feature (or attribute) based on which the data is split.\n",
        "3. **Leaf Nodes**: Represent the final prediction, i.e., the class label or regression value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The decision tree works by selecting the feature that best separates the data at each node, minimizing a criterion (like Gini impurity or Information Gain) to determine the best feature at each split.\n",
        "\n",
        "During prediction:\n",
        "- The input data traverses the tree by following decisions based on the feature values until it reaches a leaf node, which gives the predicted class.\n",

        "# Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\n",
        "'''\n",
        "The main mathematical intuition behind a decision tree classifier is to partition the dataset in a way that each partition is as pure as possible regarding the target class. The algorithm follows these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Selecting the best feature**:\n",
        "   - At each node, the algorithm evaluates each feature and selects the one that best separates the data. This is typically done by calculating a measure of **impurity**:\n",
        "     - **Gini Impurity**: Measures the impurity of a node by calculating the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element.\n",
        "       - Formula: Gini = 1 - Σ(P(class)^2), where P(class) is the probability of each class.\n",
        "     - **Entropy and Information Gain**: Entropy measures the disorder of a node. Information Gain is the reduction in entropy after a split.\n",
        "       - Formula: Information Gain = Entropy(before split) - Σ(Weighted Entropy(after split)).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Splitting the data**:\n",
        "   - The feature with the best score (highest Information Gain or lowest Gini Impurity) is chosen for the split. This process is recursively repeated until the stopping criteria are met (e.g., all data points in a node belong to the same class or max depth is reached).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Predicting**:\n",
        "   - After the tree is built, a new data point is predicted by traversing the tree based on the feature values until it reaches a leaf node. The class label of the leaf node is the predicted class.\n",
        "'''\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3. Explain how a decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem.\n",
        "'''\n",
        "In a binary classification problem, the goal is to classify data into two classes (e.g., 0 or 1, positive or negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Splitting Data**:\n",
        "   - The decision tree algorithm will start by splitting the data into two groups based on a feature that maximizes separation between the two classes. The feature that minimizes Gini impurity or maximizes Information Gain is chosen for the split.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Building the Tree**:\n",
        "   - This process is repeated recursively, splitting the data further at each node based on the best feature, until each leaf node contains data points from a single class (pure leaf) or meets a stopping criterion.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prediction**:\n",
        "   - During prediction, a data point is passed through the tree, and each split is followed based on the feature values. The final class prediction is made when the data reaches a leaf node.\n",
        "\n",
        "For binary classification, the tree will eventually output either class 0 or class 1 at the leaf node, depending on which class is dominant in the leaf node.\n",

        "# Q4. Discuss the geometric intuition behind decision tree classification and how it can be used to make predictions.\n",
        "'''\n",
        "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification is that it divides the feature space into regions (rectangular or hyper-rectangular regions in higher dimensions) based on the feature values.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Splitting the feature space**:\n",
        "   - At each decision node, the tree creates a decision boundary that partitions the space into two regions. These boundaries are parallel to the axes of the feature space, as the splits are based on feature values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Piecewise constant prediction**:\n",
        "   - Each region formed by these decision boundaries corresponds to a leaf node, where all points in that region are assigned the same class label (constant prediction). In other words, the prediction is constant within each region of the feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prediction**:\n",
        "   - To make a prediction, the input data point is placed into the feature space, and its path through the decision tree is determined based on the feature values. The prediction is then the class label of the region (leaf) where the data point ends up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geometrically, decision trees create a step-wise decision surface that classifies data points based on which region they fall into.\n",
