        "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
        "- **Ordinal Encoding**: It is used when the categorical variables have a meaningful order or ranking. The values are replaced by integers that represent the rank order. It’s used for ordinal data, where there is a clear hierarchical relationship between categories (e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High').\n",
        "- **Label Encoding**: It is used for categorical variables where there is no intrinsic order. It simply assigns a unique integer to each category. It’s used for nominal data where the order doesn’t matter (e.g., 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue').\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  - **Ordinal Encoding** would be suitable for a feature like 'Education Level' (e.g., 'High School' = 1, 'Bachelor's' = 2, 'Master's' = 3, 'PhD' = 4), since there is a clear rank.\n",
        "  - **Label Encoding** would be used for a feature like 'Color' (e.g., 'Red' = 0, 'Green' = 1, 'Blue' = 2), as the categories don't have a natural order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
        "- **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**: This encoding method replaces categories with a number that reflects the relationship between the categorical value and the target variable (i.e., dependent variable). For example, each category will be assigned a value based on its average target value or median of the target.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  In a project where you predict customer churn, you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding for a feature like 'Contract Type'. If \"Month-to-month\" contracts have a churn rate of 80%, \"One year\" contracts have a churn rate of 30%, and \"Two years\" contracts have a churn rate of 10%, you would assign these categories ordinal values reflecting the churn rate.\n",

        "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
        "- **Covariance** is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. It indicates whether an increase in one variable will result in an increase or decrease in the other variable. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance means that as one increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
